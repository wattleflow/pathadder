# WattleFlow PathAdder Library
`PathAdder` is a Python library designed for managing and modifying system paths efficiently. It allows for dynamic path addition and manipulation, making it ideal for use cases where you need to manage multiple paths for module imports or configuration files.

With `PathAdder`, you can easily add directories to the sys.path, ensuring the correct paths are in place for your application to function smoothly.

# Installation
```bash

pip install pathadder

```


# Key Features

Dynamic Path Addition – Add directories to sys.path at runtime, enabling seamless module imports from custom locations.

Path Overriding – Replace or override existing paths in sys.path, ensuring that the required directory is prioritised in module resolution.

Recursive Path Searching – Search directories recursively to find specific files or subdirectories, ensuring paths are correctly set for complex directory structures.

Path Listing – Easily view and verify all paths currently in sys.path using built-in methods for path inspection.
